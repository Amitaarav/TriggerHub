# TriggerHub

TriggerHub is a Zapier-like automation platform designed to handle event-driven workflows with a robust microservices architecture. It integrates with webhooks, Kafka for event streaming, and Prisma for database management.

## 🌐 Extended Description
TriggerHub is built to simplify complex automation workflows by allowing users to create custom triggers and actions seamlessly. The platform is structured with a microservices architecture, ensuring that each component (frontend, backend, hooks, processor, worker) operates independently for optimal performance and scalability. Leveraging the power of Kafka for real-time data streaming and Prisma ORM for efficient database interactions, TriggerHub offers a highly responsive and fault-tolerant environment. 

The platform supports:
- **Custom Webhooks:** Enabling integration with third-party APIs for dynamic data exchange.
- **Event Processing:** Kafka ensures real-time event streaming and processing with high throughput.
- **Workflow Automation:** Design and manage workflows through user-friendly interfaces, powered by Next.js and React.
- **Robust Data Management:** PostgreSQL and Prisma handle data integrity and scalability effortlessly.

## 🚀 Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Seamless handling of triggers and actions.
- **Microservices:** Decoupled services for better scalability.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Kafka-powered asynchronous message processing.
- **Flexible Webhooks:** Custom hooks for external integrations.
- **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensures reliable event processing with Kafka consumer groups and retries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Axios, React-flow
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **Event Streaming:** Kafka
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Dev Tools:** ESLint, TypeScript, Docker

## 📦 Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Kafka (for event streaming)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amitaarav/TriggerHub.git
cd TriggerHub
```

### Install Dependencies
For **Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
For **Backend (Primary & Hooks)**:
```bash
cd primbackend
npm install
cd ../hooks
npm install
```
For **Processor & Worker**:
```bash
cd processor
npm install
cd ../worker
npm install
```

## ⚙️ Configuration
Create a `.env` file in each service directory with necessary environment variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092
JWT_PASSWORD=your_secret_password
PORT=3000
```

## 🚀 Running the Application
### Start Kafka (Ensure Kafka is running locally or remotely)
```bash
# Start Kafka broker (if using Docker)
docker-compose up -d
```

### Start All Services
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Primary Backend
cd ../primbackend
npm run dev

# Hooks Backend
cd ../hooks
npm run dev

# Processor
cd ../processor
npm run dev

# Worker
cd ../worker
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Running Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

├── processor/         # Kafka Event Processor
└── worker/            # Kafka Event Worker
```

## Processor
-Processor pushes data to kafka topic named "zap-events" with key "zap" and value as the event data. 

## Worker
-Worker pulls and listens to the "zap-events" topic and processes the events.
